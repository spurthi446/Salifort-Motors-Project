# Salifort-Motors-Project

Description and deliverables
This capstone project is an opportunity for you to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

Upon completion, you will have two artifacts that you would be able to present to future employers. One is a brief one-page summary of this project that you would present to external stakeholders as the data professional in Salifort Motors. The other is a complete code notebook provided here. Please consider your prior course work and select one way to achieve this given project question. Either use a regression model or machine learning model to predict whether or not an employee will leave the company. The exemplar following this actiivty shows both approaches, but you only need to do one.

In your deliverables, you will include the model evaluation (and interpretation if applicable), a data visualization(s) of your choice that is directly related to the question you ask, ethical considerations, and the resources you used to troubleshoot and find answers or solutions.

Understand the business scenario and problem
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

Your goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
